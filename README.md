#  Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects.

What is Window Object ?

The window object is the global object representing the browser window or tab in which your webpage is displayed. Every time you open a new browser 
window or tab, a new window object is created. This object is the top-level container for everything that happens in a browser.


 What is document object ?

The document object, on the other hand, represents the HTML content (the Document Object Model, or DOM) that is loaded in the browser window. 
It is a child of the window object. The document object allows you to interact with and manipulate the HTML and CSS of the webpage.
